Instructions for starting up the web app:

1- Required libraries:
    - joblib
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - sklearn (Make sure it's version 1.5.1 or newer)
    - streamlit
    - PyArrow
    - amadeus (future flight info API)
    - meteostat (weather forecast API)
    - matplotlib
    - warning

    - If you don't have any of the above libaries:
        - pip install "library name"

    - If you need to update a version of a library:
        - pip install "library name"=="version_number"
        - pip install --upgrade "library name"

2- Relevant Python codes:
    - modeling_scoring.py (Custom library containing classes for model scoring)
    - flight_planning_webapp.py (Web app using Streamlit)

3- How to run the web app locally:
    - In command line or terminal, navigate to this directory and type:
        - streamlit run flight_planning_webapp.py
    - After running the above command, you will be provided a local URL in the form:
        - http://localhost.8501
    - Open that URL in your web browser.

4- Recommendations for testing the web app:
    - The web app is unlikely to be set up to handle all edge cases.
    - In addition, the API used to get actual flight info is using a test environment and is unstable.
    - To ensure testing success, keep flight API deactivated.
    - Check "flight_api_test_data.csv" for scenarios that will work.
